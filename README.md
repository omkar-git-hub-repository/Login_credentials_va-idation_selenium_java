# Login Validation using Selenium Java

This is a simple Selenium project to validate login functionality using valid and invalid data. The project is built using Java and follows the Page Object Model (POM) structure for efficient organization of test scripts and page elements.

## Project Goal

The purpose of this project is to:

1. Test login functionality with both valid and invalid credentials.
2. Demonstrate basic automation testing using Selenium WebDriver with Java.
3. Practice organizing code using the Page Object Model (POM).

## Features

- Validates login with:
  - Correct credentials (successful login).
  - Incorrect credentials (error message validation).
- Uses the POM structure to separate test logic from page elements.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **Maven**: For dependency management.
- **Eclipse IDE**: For running the tests.
- **TestNG Plugin**: Installed in Eclipse.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Compatible with your browser version.
- A compatible **browser driver** (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver).
